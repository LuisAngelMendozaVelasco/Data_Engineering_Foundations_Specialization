# Course Assignment

This module contains the final project for this course. You will consolidate the skills that you learned throughout this course by applying them to a specific scenario. To complete the project successfully, you must demonstrate that you have the skills to design a database from a new set of data, including creating an ERD to identify entities, attributes, and relationships. You will normalize tables, create your database, and load some data. You will also demonstrate some database management tasks by working with views.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the importance of a good database design.
- Create an ERD of a database.
- Generate and execute an SQL script from an ERD to create a schema.
- Load a database schema with data.
- Identify entities and attributes.
- Normalize tables.
- Define keys and relationships.
- Build database objects by generating and running an SQL script the pgAdmin ERD Tool.
- Create a view and a materialized view and export from each data.
- Import data into a Db2 database and a MySQL database.
- Evaluate the completeness and technical correctness of the database design and implementation performed by your peers using the provided rubric and grading scheme.
