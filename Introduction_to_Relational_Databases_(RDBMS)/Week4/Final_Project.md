# Final Project

In this lab you will complete the peer graded assignment using a SQL practice tool called DataSette in the Skills Network Lab environment. 

Clicking on the "Launch App" button will open the Lab instructions and Lab environment side-by-side in a new browser tab.  

In case you did not or were unable to complete the previous lab using Db2, you can use DataSette in this lab instead. If you already completed the previous lab with Db2, you can skip this lab.
