# Using Relational Databases

In this module, you will learn how to use a RDBMS GUI or web interface and SQL statements to create and manage the tables in a relational database and populate them with data. You will also learn how to employ some database design techniques that help improve the integrity of your data and the performance of your queries, including the use of Primary and Foreign keys to define relationships, indexes, normalization, and relational model constraints.

## Learning Objectives

- Differentiate DML and DDL SQL statements.
- Create and alter a simple table in Db2 on Cloud.
- Explain how to use a CREATE statement to create entities or tables in a database.
- Explain the purpose of backup and restore utilities for moving data into and out of a database.
- Discuss when to use load functionality.
- Move data to and from a database using the LOAD, BACKUP, RESTORE, IMPORT, and EXPORT utilities.
- Modify an existing table using the ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, and TRUNCATE TABLE statements.
- Build a table structure and load data by using an SQL script file.
- List the objects in a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) hierarchy.
- Create relationships between tables using keys.
- Identify the advantages and disadvantages of using indexes.
- Create indexes.
- Reduce data redundancy and inconsistency in databases by using normalization.
- Describe the different types of relational model constraints.
- Maintain data integrity in a relational data model by using constraints.
