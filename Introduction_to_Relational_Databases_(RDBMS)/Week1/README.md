# Relational Database Concepts

A relational database organizes data into tables that can be linked—or related—based on data common to each. By storing your business data in a relational database, you can retrieve and analyze the data to make important business decisions. There are many companies that offer relational database systems and, regardless of which one you use, they all share a common set of characteristics that you must be familiar with before you can move on to more advanced operations with databases. In this module, you will learn some basic relational database concepts and how to diagram and describe the relationships between tables in a database. You will also learn the different deployment topologies and architectures that are commonly used, who the typical users of databases are, and some of the features and benefits of some common relational database management systems including Db2, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

## Learning Objectives

- Define data, list the types and sources of data, and recall data storage options.
- Explain the advantages of the relational database model over other models.
- Define relational databases and their supporting systems.
- Describe relational model concepts, including entities, attributes, and entity-relationship (E-R) models.
- Summarize the types of relationships in a relational database.
- Explain how an E-R diagram translates into a relational database table with rows and columns.
- Describe data types commonly used in databases and the advantages of using appropriate data types.
- Analyze a database by using relational concepts including entity, attribute, relation, degree, and cardinality.
- Contrast relational schema with relational instances.
- Differentiate the database deployment topologies: single tier, 2-tier, 3-tier, and Cloud.
- Define shared disk distributed database architectures, replication, partitioning, and sharding and list the benefits of each.
- Explain why and how different categories of users need access to databases.
- Summarize the history of relational databases.
- Describe the features and benefits of Db2.
- Explain how to work with MySQL and list some of the MySQL storage engines.
- Discuss how to use PostgreSQL and describe PostgreSQL’s replication functionality.
- Create a Db2 service instance on IBM Cloud.
