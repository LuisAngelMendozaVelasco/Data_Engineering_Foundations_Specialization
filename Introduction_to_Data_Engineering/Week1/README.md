# What is Data Engineering?

In this module, you will learn about the different entities that come together to form a modern data ecosystem and the role Data Engineers, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Business Analysts, and Business Intelligence Analysts play in this ecosystem. You will learn what data engineering is and the key tasks in a data engineering lifecycle. You will also gain an understanding of the responsibilities of a data engineer, the skillsets they need in order to be successful, and what a typical day in the life of a data engineer looks like.

## Learning Objectives
